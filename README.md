# Snake Game
## [Play Online](https://snake-ochre-alpha.vercel.app)
This is a simple snake game implemented using React and Vite. To play, simply open the project in your browser and use the arrow keys to control the snake. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without running into the wall or yourself.

The game is written in TypeScript and uses the React Hooks API. The game state is stored in the component's state and the game logic is implemented in the component's event handlers.

The game is rendered using SVG elements and the game board is divided into a grid of squares. The snake is represented by a sequence of connected squares and the apple is represented by a single square.

The game is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes.

To build the game, run `npm run build`. This will create a production build of the game in the `dist` directory.

To start the development server, run `npm run dev`. This will start the development server and open the game in your browser.
